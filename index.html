        <sup>Winter. Time to eat fat
            and watch hockey. In the pewter mornings, the cat,
            a black fur sausage with yellow
            Houdini eyes, jumps up on the bed and tries
            to get onto my head. It’s his
            way of telling whether or not I’m dead.
            If I’m not, he wants to be scratched; if I am
            He’ll think of something. He settles
            on my chest, breathing his breath
            of burped-up meat and musty sofas,
            purring like a washboard. Some other tomcat,
            not yet a capon, has been spraying our front door,
            declaring war. It’s all about sex and territory,
            which are what will finish us off
            in the long run. Some cat owners around here
            should snip a few testicles. If we wise
            hominids were sensible, we’d do that too,
            or eat our young, like sharks.
            But it’s love that does us in. Over and over
            again, He shoots, he scores! and famine
            crouches in the bedsheets, ambushing the pulsing
            eiderdown, and the windchill factor hits
            thirty below, and pollution pours
            out of our chimneys to keep us warm.
            February, month of despair,
            with a skewered heart in the centre.
            I think dire thoughts, and lust for French fries
            with a splash of vinegar.
            Cat, enough of your greedy whining
            and your small pink bumhole.
            Off my face! You’re the life principle,
            more or less, so get going
            on a little optimism around here. Get rid of death
            Celebrate increase, Make it be springWinter. Time to eat fat
            and watch hockey. In the pewter mornings, the cat,
            a black fur sausage with yellow
            Houdini eyes, jumps up on the bed and tries
